## Implementation

As part of this thesis, a solution was programmed in order to implement both methodologies whether Box Jenkins and LSTM Neural Network and get the most accurace forecasts possible, which code can be found here:

- [Box Jenkins R coding](): Box Jenkins
- [LSTM Neural Network](): LSTM Neural Network
